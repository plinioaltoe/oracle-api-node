# oracle-api-node

A rest API based on "Creating a REST API with Node.js and Oracle Database" (https://jsao.io/2018/03/creating-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-oracle-database/)

- You have to install an oracle database and set the environment variables credentials to access database. See config/database.js file.
- run "npm install" or "yarn" to install dependencies.
- run "node ."

Your server will be ready. So you just need config your routes/controllers API server.
